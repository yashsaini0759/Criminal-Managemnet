"I am uploading a ZIP file named Criminal-Management-System-main.zip. Please carefully follow these instructions and generate a fully runnable project for me:

🗂 Step 1: Analyze the Uploaded Folder

Extract the ZIP file and look into its folder structure.

Study all .java files inside src/CriminalManagementSystem/ (AdminPage.java, LogIn.java, OperatorPage.java, SQLConnection.java, etc.).

Also check the mysql-connector-java folder (contains JDBC driver) and any report/diagram files for database schema hints.

🎯 Step 2: Project Goal

This is a Database Management System project for managing criminal records.

The final project should run smoothly in Replit with proper database connectivity and a modern, user-friendly UI.

🔑 Step 3: Features & Requirements
User Roles:

Admin

Secure login.

Add/Edit/Delete criminal records.

Manage FIRs.

Manage Operators.

Generate reports (PDF/Excel).

Operator

Secure login.

Add/View criminal records.

Add FIR details.

Limited access (no delete/edit).

Database Schema:

CriminalRecords Table

id (PK, auto)

name, age, gender, crime_type, fir_number, case_status, arrest_date, address, photo

FIRRecords Table

fir_id (PK, auto)

criminal_id (FK)

fir_number, fir_date, description

Users Table

user_id (PK, auto)

username, password (hashed), role (Admin/Operator)

🎨 Step 4: UI/UX Requirements

Replace old Java Swing UI with a modern responsive UI (React.js frontend or JavaFX if keeping Java).

Add Light & Dark mode toggle.

Sidebar menu with: Dashboard, Criminal Records, FIR Records, Operators, Reports.

Clean, professional design (blue, grey, white color scheme).

Data tables with search, filter, and pagination.

Upload & display photos of criminals.

Dashboard with charts (crime types, open vs closed cases).

🔧 Step 5: Technical Setup

Use Java + MySQL + JDBC (or Spring Boot + React + MySQL if you prefer modern stack).

Make the project fully runnable in Replit. If MySQL hosting is difficult inside Replit, switch to SQLite but keep schema same.

Ensure proper role-based authentication.

Reports must be exportable to PDF/Excel.

Provide dummy data for testing.

📦 Step 6: Deliverables

Complete source code with proper folder structure.

Database setup script (.sql file).

A README.md with step-by-step instructions:

How to set up database.

How to run the project in Replit.

How to test login (Admin & Operator sample credentials).

Dummy screenshots & sample data.

Ensure the project is actually runnable inside Replit, not just explained.

👉 Important: Do not just explain. Extract the uploaded folder, analyze the files, refactor them if needed, and generate the complete runnable project with modern UI. Make sure the final output runs inside Replit without manual fixes.
